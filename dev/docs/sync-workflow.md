# Team Sync Workflow

## Frontend Developer (Hostinger)
1. Make changes in Hostinger website builder
2. Before making changes:
   - Notify backend developer
   - Take a backup of the site
3. After completing changes:
   - Export updated pages/templates
   - Share export files with backend developer
   - Document changes made in Hostinger

## Backend Developer (GitHub)
1. Custom development workflow:
   - Work on feature branches
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Create pull requests for major changes
2. After frontend updates:
   - Pull latest changes
   - Integrate frontend exports
   - Resolve any conflicts
   - Push updated code

## Synchronization Steps
1. **Daily Sync**
   - Morning check-in on planned changes
   - End-of-day backup of both environments

2. **Change Management**
   - Frontend: Document all Hostinger builder changes
   - Backend: Comment all custom code changes
   - Both: Use the shared project board for tracking

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Identify overlapping changes early
   - Test changes in staging environment
   - Regular sync meetings for complex changes

4. **Deployment Process**
   - Test all changes in staging
   - Coordinate deployment timing
   - Maintain backup points
   - Document all deployed changes

## Best Practices
1. **Communication**
   - Use shared project board
   - Daily quick sync calls
   - Document all significant changes

2. **Version Control**

   - Meaningful commit messages
   - Feature branches for new functionality

3. **Testing**
   - Test changes in staging environment
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness checks

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with changes
   - Document dependencies
   - Maintain deployment checklist
